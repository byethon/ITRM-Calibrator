You can test this example by running
./Calibrate RAW.csv LEA.csv OUT.csv

This example uses a DIY test rig along with Tripowin Lea's FR plot from Precogvision'squig.
The .csv for this IEM has been generated using https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ (WebPlotDigitizer by Ankit Rohatgi)

The RAW.csv has been generated using REW (Room EQ Wizard) using no calibration for the mic and directly attaching the IEM to the rig for a raw response. The level target was around 83db for this run.

The Out.csv can now be loaded as a calibration file for REW giving fairly accurate results.
